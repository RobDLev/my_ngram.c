# Welcome to My Ngram

## Task
This project involved making a program that can count the number of appearances of individual 
characters in a given string or series of strings. Creating a program that requires multipe files
assembled with a Makefile was also a new concept for this assignment.

## Description
This program utilizes the ASCII table character values as indices in an array allowing the value
stored in that index to increase by one each time that character appeared in the given string(s).
This approach was advantagous because it allowed the characters and character counts to be displayed
in alphabetical order, regardless of the order the characters appeared in the string(s).

## Installation
In the terminal, enter the command "make". Once the executable file is ready, call it using
"./my_ngram" followed by one or more strings, whose individual characters will be counted and 
displayed for you.

## Usage
Once the exectuable file has been prepared, the program can be called with new strings as often
as you like using the format below:

./my_ngram argument1 argument2
